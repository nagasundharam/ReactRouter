            <p>A router is a physical device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It performs the traffic directing functions on an internetwork. A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks. When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the network address information in the packet to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.
Routers are an essential part of the internet. They allow different networks to communicate with each other, and they help to ensure that data packets are delivered to the correct destination.</p>
